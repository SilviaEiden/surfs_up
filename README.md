# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this study is to provide W. Avy, an investor who’s passionate about surfing, a weather analysis for financial backing on the Surf n’ Shake venture. Surf n’ Shake is proposed as a shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists in the beautiful island Oahu, Hawaii. 

Using Python and SQLAlchemy, a summary statistics for temperatures in June and December was generated by performing an exploratory analysis on the weather data. This analysis can be used to seal the deal with W. Avy and put him at ease that Surf n’ Shake is a business worth investing. Aloha Hawaii!

## Results

### Dataset and Files

The analysis is based on the following SQLite database and dataset: 

* Weather Data: [hawaii](hawaii.sqlite)

The analysis is available here: [SurfsUp_Challenge](SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb)

### Software and Application

The software and web-based application used for this analysis are:

* Python Version 3.7.11 (using PythonData environment and Pandas Library)
* Jupyter Notebook Version 6.4.6
* SQLAlchemy Version 1.4.31
* SQLite Version 3.37

### Outcomes 

The data summary below provides solid statistical analysis—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles for temperatures in June and December, respectively. The count is the number of times temperature was observed.

Here are 3 points worth noting from the above temperature summary statistics:

* An initial data exploration on weather dataset was done to filter the months of June and December from all the years of data available in the SQLite database. As data was retrieved, it was found that the total number of times temperature was observed for June was 1,700 and for December was 1,517. Note the last row of data available in the database is August 23, 2017, hence the difference of 183 in count between June and December.

To obtain specific temperature data, the **extract function** along with the **query method** was used for the month of June as follows:

```
June = []
June = session.query(Measurement.tobs).filter(extract('month', Measurement.date)==6).all()
```

And for the month of December as follows:

```
December = []
December = session.query(Measurement.tobs).filter(extract('month', Measurement.date)==12).all()
```

* Moreover, the mean or average temperature for June is 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 71 degrees Fahrenheit for December; rounded up to the nearest tenth.  This displays temperatures during the Summer and Winter seasons are not far off from each other and are consistent year-round.

* Lastly, it is observed that 75% of the time the temperature for June and December sets at 77 degrees Fahrenheit and 74 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. This allows to have confidence that Surf n’ Shake can be open for business throughout the year.

“The best time to visit Hawaii is between March and September. This is when the islands see the highest temperatures and the lowest amount of rain. It's the perfect time to enjoy the beach or the water.”
